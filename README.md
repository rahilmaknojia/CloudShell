# CloudShell

### Scope
Purpose of this project is to build a cloud integration that will allow you to manage cloud components regardless where they are.

### Focus
We will be focusing on Microsoft Azure Cloud as our first platform provisioning to manage VM's, AppServices, and many more.

### Future proposal
Once we have Azure platform provisioning completed. We will then move to Google Cloud and follow sme with AWS.

### Technology
We will be using .NET core as our core development platform. Why did we choose .NET Core? Microsoft has made .NET open source and can be ran on any OS. So we decided to go with .NET Core as we feel comfortable in .NET technology.
